Once you get close enough to the Red Planet your ship turns gold.  Congratulations!  Next you will be transported to a new galaxy, with a different asteroid field to explore and a new Red Planet to find.  Positions are randomly generated, so the difficulty of your search will vary from one galaxy to the next; some will seem easier, some harder.

> **Tip:** The Red Planet might be hidden behind an asteroid, so if you don't spot it right away, move around and keep looking.

Note although your ship turns red for a few seconds if you crash into an asteroid, there is no damage meter or fuel gauge. Thus you cannot "die" and can keep playing as long as you want.
This game designed for the Oculus Rift DK2, but will also run in a web browser and in "preview mode" on GearVR, Google Cardboard, or any smartphone.
