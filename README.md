This simple but ground-breaking WebVR game is implemented using Javascript and runs in a web browser, unlike Oculus Rift games built for PC or Mac using game engines like Unity3d.

Requirements:

1. VR-enabled build of Firefox Nightly ([download from Mozilla](http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/08/20/updated-firefox-vr-builds))
2. Oculus Rift DK2 ([order from Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/order/))
3. Desktop or Laptop computer


###How To Play
Navigate the asteroid field to reach the Red Planet!

> **Controls:**

> - **Forward** thrusters: Left mouse button *or* W key 
> - **Backward** thrusters: Center mouse button *or* S key  
>   (or thumb Back button, if your mouse has one)

To start the game, click the "VR" button at the top-left of the page, or press the Enter key.  This will put your browser into full-screen VR mode, and you may need to click "Allow" to confirm.  Be sure your Oculus Rift DK2 is connected to your computer, or else you will get the "No HMD found" error message.

Once you get close enough to the Red Planet it will turn blue.  Congratulations!  Next you will be transported to a new galaxy, with a different asteroid field to explore and a new Red Planet to find.  The asteroid and planet positions are randomly generated, so the difficulty of your search will vary from one galaxy to the next; some will seem easier, some harder.

> **Tip:** The Red Planet might be hidden behind an asteroid, so if you don't spot it right away, move around and keep looking.

Note there is no "end" to the game, as it was designed to be used in a demo (or party!) situation.  After the player finds the Red Planet once, or as many times as they want, they can pass the Oculus Rift DK2 headset to the next player who can start playing immediately, without reloading the page.  

VR Planet Chase can be played seated in front of your laptop or desktop computer, but is best enjoyed as a "standing VR" experience, so you can turn around 360 degrees.  If you have a wireless mouse, you can hold it in your hand so you don't need to touch the keyboard or desk while playing.  Take care not to get tangled in the cord connecting your Rift to your computer, or use [VR Backpack](http://vrbackpack.com) (one of my other projects) for untethered Oculus Rift gaming.
