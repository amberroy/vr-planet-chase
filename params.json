{"name":"Vr-planet-chase","tagline":"WebVR Game created for VR Hackathon","body":"VR Planet Chase\r\n===============\r\nWorld's First browser-based virtual reality game!  [PLAY NOW](http://amberroy.github.io/vr-planet-chase/vrplanetchase.html)\r\n\r\nShare link: http://VRplanetchase.com\r\n\r\nThis simple but ground-breaking WebVR game is implemented using Javascript and runs in a web browser, See [WebVR.info](http://webvr.info) for more info and to download a VR-enabled build of Chromium (not yet tested on Firefox Nightly).\r\n\r\n####Navigate the asteroid field to reach the Red Planet!\r\n\r\nCONTROLS: **WASD** keys move ship, **arrow keys** steer ship, move your head to look around.\r\n\r\n![VR Planet Chase screenshot](screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n### How To Play\r\n\r\nTo start the game, click the \"WEBVR\" button at the botton of the page, or press the Enter key.  This will put your browser into full-screen VR mode, and you may need to click \"Allow\" to confirm.  This game designed for the Oculus Rift DK2, but thanks to webvr-boilerplace it will also run in a standard web browser (cannot look around due to lack of head tracking) and in \"preview mode\" on GearVR or Google Cardboard (cannot move or steer the ship due to lack of a keyboard).\r\n\r\n> **Tip:** The Red Planet might be hidden behind an asteroid, so if you don't spot it right away, move around and keep looking.\r\n\r\nOnce you get close enough to the Red Planet you will hear a Victory sound effect and the ship will turn gold.  Congratulations!  Next you will be transported to a new galaxy, with a different asteroid field to explore and a new Red Planet to find.  The asteroid and planet positions are randomly generated, so the difficulty of your search will vary from one galaxy to the next; some will seem easier, some harder.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote there is no \"end\" to the game, as it was designed to be used in a demo situation, where users play for a few minutes than pass the Oculus Rift DK2 to the next player.  Although your ship turns red for a few seconds if you crash into an asteroid, there is no damage meter or fuel gauge, so you cannot \"die\" in the game and can keep playing as long as you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Credits**  \r\nCode: Amber Roy (Twitter [@amberroyVR])[http://twitter.com/amberroyVR]  \r\nMusic: Lloyd Boland (Soundcloud)[https://soundcloud.com/lloydboland/interstellar-unfinished]  \r\n\r\nHistory: Version 1 (10-18-2014), Version 2 (05-23-2015).  \r\nAwards: Version 2 won 2nd Place in Best Web-Based VR App in May 2015 [VR Hackathon](http://vrhackathon.com)  \r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) Amber Roy 2014.
